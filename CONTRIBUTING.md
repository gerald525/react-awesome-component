Please abide by the following:

- Keep the alphabetic sort order of components.
- Reference a component only once.
- Describe it succinctly, sufficiently, and without flair.
- Don't mention "React" in the description.
- Keep descriptions to one line (no wrapping). Use the `Preview changes` tab before committing to ensure this.
- If available, please also include a direct link to a demo site.
- If available, please also include a direct link to a separate docs site.

Here's an example of how your listing should appear:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - [demo](https://reactjs.org/) - [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# TO ADD A LISTING, YOU MUST REMOVE ONE (or more) UN-AWESOME COMPONENT IN ANY PR.

This is a requirement for listing!

We want this list to remain fresh. So when you do ANY PR, please also remove at least
1 un-awesome component. This could be a component that hasn't been updated in
a year or more; a component that has been replaced by better options; or one
that just doesn't really seem "awesome" anymore.
